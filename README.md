# **Portfolio Website**

Welcome to the repository of my simple, CV-inspired portfolio, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I wanted this portfolio to be rooted in simplicity and functionality, aiming to present information in a clear, concise manner while maintaining an aesthetic appeal.

      <p className="mt-6 text-sm sm:text-base leading-6 text-neutral-800/80"> I'm a full-time high school student passionate about design, research, and coding. Over the past year, I've taken on the task of designing and developing several projects. Most recently, I've begun leading the development of the front-end interface for a collaborative full-stack application created for the Murphy Charitable Foundation in Uganda. Beyond coding, I am deeply passionate about advocacy, especially for language access within education. I'm also an immigrant from Kyrgyzstan and speak fluent Russian and English.</p>

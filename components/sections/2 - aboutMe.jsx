      <p className="mt-6 text-sm sm:text-base leading-6 text-neutral-800/80">I'm a full-time high school student passionate about design, research, and coding. Over the past year, I've taken on the task of designing and developing several projects. Most recently, I've won the Washington State University 2024 CougHacks Hackathon with a few friends. Beyond coding, I am deeply passionate about advocacy, especially for language access within education. I'm also an immigrant from Kyrgyzstan and speak fluent Russian and English.</p>
